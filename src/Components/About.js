<p>Wife, mother, and self-taught front-end web developer. Self-taught means that I learned everything from scratch and had the tenacity to keep going without any incentive pushing me forward except for my own dreams and passion. It means that I reached out and found a supportive community on my own and that I learned how to work alongside others from far away. I am dedicated. I have taken the time to research topics that I'm not familiar with and I have learned to ask questions and give answers. I am going to use the skills that I have to keep advancing.</p>

<p>I am currently living in Costa Rica and am fully bilingual (English/Spanish). I really love the values of this company and know that I would make a great fit. Please look around and click on my CV's.</p> 

<p>I look forward to hearing back soon. Have a great week!</p>
